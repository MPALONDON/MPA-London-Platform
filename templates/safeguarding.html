                        <p>MPA has appointed a Designated Safeguarding Person (DSP) who is responsible for dealing with any concerns about the protection of children. The role of the DSP is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Act as the first point of contact for staff or volunteers concerned about the safety and welfare of a child</li>
                            <li>Be responsible for contacting the Children's Social Services Department in cases where a child is at risk of harm</li>

                        <h3>DSP Response to Concerns</h3>
                        <p>Once a concern has been raised with the DSP, the DSP should consider whether the concern involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immediate risk of significant harm</li>
                            <li>A clear allegation of abuse by the child</li>
                            <li>No immediate risk of significant harm</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The DSP will take appropriate action based on the nature of the concern:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the child requires immediate medical treatment, the DSP will arrange treatment in communication with the child's parents (if safety allows)</li>
                            <li>Where there is not an immediate risk of significant harm, if safety allows, the DSP will talk to the group's designated responsible adult Group Leader and the child's parents</li>
                            <li>The DSP may talk to MPA Management Team and other professional agencies including the NSPCC helpline to determine the best course of action</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>When contemplating referrals to children's social care, consider the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do you have sufficient information about the child if a referral is to be made?</li>
                            <li>What other information do you need to make an informed decision and how should you go about obtaining it?</li>
                            <li>Is there reason to have concerns about the child's immediate safety?</li>
                            <li>Are there issues of consent and/or confidentiality in respect of sharing information?</li>
                            <li>Who else should you share the information with, and when and how should this be done?</li>
                            <li>Have you and/or other staff written a report of the concerns, ensuring this accurately reflects anything a child has said and distinguishes clearly between fact and opinion?</li>
                            <li>Have you taken account of the child's right to know what action, if any, will be taken?</li>
                            <li>Have you ascertained their wishes and feelings?</li>
                            <li>Have you provided for the child's immediate support needs? Have you considered any support needs of the person reporting the concerns?</li>

                        <h3>Important Guidelines</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Delay reporting the matter by trying to obtain more information</li>

                        <p>Practice issues:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be specific – what is the exact nature of the concern and which category of abuse does it suggest</li>
                            <li>Show the evidence – What did you see, hear? Who said what, when, where, how?</li>
                            <li>Be precise with time words – what does always, frequent, never mean?</li>
                            <li>State your professional judgment</li>
                            <li>Ensure your professional judgment is supported by the evidence</li>
                            <li>Copies of records and referrals should be kept in line with MPA's data protection policy and procedure</li>

                    <section class="confidentiality-section mt-4">
                        <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Confidentiality and Information Sharing</h2>
                        <p>Care must be taken to ensure that both adults and children's confidentiality is maintained and that information is handled and disseminated on a need to know basis only. Individuals must be confident that information held about them by MPA will only be disclosed to others either with their consent or when there is a legal duty to do so.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Good Practice Principles</h3>
                        <p>Good practice principles must be adhered to when handling personal information:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Personal information is obtained and processed fairly and lawfully</li>
                            <li>Only disclosed in appropriate circumstances</li>
                            <li>Accurate, relevant and not held for longer than necessary</li>
                            <li>Kept securely</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Information Sharing Without Consent</h3>
                        <p>Guidance allows for the disclosure of personal information without consent of the subject in certain conditions, including for the purposes of the prevention and detection of a crime, for example where there is a child protection concern.</p>
                        
                        <p>It is best to gain verbal or written consent from a child or parent/carer before any personal information relating to them is shared with another organisation (such as Children's Social Services Department). However, you may not need to seek consent to share information if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It might be unsafe to seek consent</li>
                            <li>It causes an unjustified delay</li>
                            <li>It would prejudice the prevention, detection or prosecution of a serious crime</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>When in doubt, advice should always be sought from someone experienced in dealing with these issues, such as a Children's Social Services Department or the NSPCC Helpline.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Recording Information Sharing</h3>
                        <p>In all cases where information is shared, the following information should be recorded:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Date and time</li>
                            <li>Summary of information shared</li>
                            <li>Who the information was shared with</li>
                            <li>Whether you are sharing with or without consent</li>
                            <li>If sharing without consent, whether the child or family were informed</li>
                            <li>How the information was shared and any receipt of it having been received</li>
                        </ul>
